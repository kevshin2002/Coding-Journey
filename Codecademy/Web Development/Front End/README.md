# Full-Stack Engineer Path
## Description
In this path, it'll go over all of the major technologies that a full-stack developer should know. This course will solidfy a foundation in JavaScript programming, be able to use front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, React, and build secure back-ends with Node/Express and PostgreSQL.

## Learning Objectives
- Set up your own dev environment and version control our work with Git/Github
- Write client-side and server-side JavaScript code
- Create static, responsive websites with HTML/CSS
- Use the popular React front-end framework, along with Redux
- Build Node/Express back-ends
- Design and build PostgreSQL databases
- Connect a front-end to a back-end for a full-stack PERN application
- Implement best security practices to prevent attacks
- Pass a JavaScript whiteboard interview

## Projects
- Mixed Messages : A node.js app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program and version our project with Git/Github
- Personal Portfolio Project : Use HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages to build a personal portfolio site, a static website where we can share other projects.
- Reddit Client : Use JavaScript, React, Redux, and the Reddit API, build an online forum containing real-life data.
- E-Commerce Site (Two Parts) : Over the course of two parts, build a full-stack web app where users can purchase products using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node)
- Open-Ended Project : A project of our choosing using what we learned in this path.


## Why Fullstack?
You may be wondering why I as an Electrical Engineer who want to do controls and machine is learning fullstack development\
I believe that one should always be learning, regardless of what subject it is.\
This intersectionality will allow me to experience fullstack issues and build a more solid foundation so that I may be contribute more to whatever I am working on.

Plus, it's also nice to know and understand how things work and I can use this to create my personal website and resume.
