The front end is the part of the app that the user will see and is nicely designed and easy to use. The back-end is where all the data is stored and requests are processed.
The user can make requests from the front-end to do things in the back-end such as placing an order. Users though cannot go into the back-end.


When a user visits a website, the HTML and CSS files are retrieved from the back-end and displayed in the users browsers. 
What the user see is the front-end and simple websites can be built just with HTML and CSS.
If a user wants to interact with the website or handle requests from the user, we require Javascript.
This allows users to interact with the back-end from the front-end.

Complex web-apps that deal with tons of interaction can quickly have issues such as:
Time-consuming to write
Difficult to maintain
Hard to optimize

These issues are solved by front-end frameworks which are Javascript libaries which allows us to create complex front-end apps with ease.
They provide simple shortcuts for implementing common front-end features and optimizing front-end code behind the scenes.

Frameworks aim to make front-end:
quicker to write
easier to update
speedier

Each framework solve these issues differently but they all strive to make front-end easier.
