How is data sent from one computer to another?
What is the relationship between a browser and a server?
How is code turned into the experience that users see in their browsers?
How has the web and web development changed from its invention to today?

How does the internet work?
Browsers takes the web address that is provided by the user and is sent to a server across the internet for the files that make up the website. The server is dedicated to holding the site information.

Browsers and Servers communicate via the internet protocol known as the HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol.
The common HTTP requests are:
GET : used to retrieve information from the given server
POST : used to send data to the server
PUT : used to replace current data with uploaded content
DELETE : removes current data

HTTP Status Codes:
200 : request succeeded
301 : Resource has been moved and the client is being redirected
404 : The request resource was not found
500 : The server encountered an unexpected error


A browser is made up of several things:
HTML/CSS/JS

HTML is responsible for the text, CSS is for the stylistic elements, while JavaScript is for the interactive behavior. A webpage that doesn't use JavaScript is known as a static webpage.

HTML elements with content inside them always requires a closing tag. An HTML element without a closing tag will cause nested items. Some elements don't require closing tag and they're known as "void" tags such as <br>, <img>, and <link> as they don't have content.
An attribute in HTML provides additional information about an HTML element. It comes in a name and value pair with the structure name="value".
Linked are created in HTML with something called the href attribute which stends for hyperlink reference.

What is CSS?
HTML contains the skeletal structure of the webpage. It's a black and white website. To make it creative, CSS provides style to the content of an HTML page. This includes colors, fonts, positioning, layout, and more.
The reason why it's separate is because of the computer science principle of separation of concerns. Large codebases are kept maintainable when each section has clearly differentiated problems that it is trying to solve.

Since styling rules are described separately from the content itself, if someone adds more paragraphs, images, or other forms of content, the existing content will remain the same.
CSS contains selectors that specify the HTML elements to which the style should be applied as well as the visual rules that specify how that content should be displayed.

What is JavaScript?
JavaScript allows users to interact with a website.
Exampels of JavaScript on website includes:
popup ads
animated graphics (2D or 3D)
interactive audio and video
maps and other features access the user's geographic location

One defining feature of JavaScript is it's ability to respond to browser events. These events happen in real time and can be triggered by a wide variety of user interactions, including:
the user clicking on a button
the user pressing enter on their keyboard
a video file finishing loading
the user re-sizing their window
the user hovering over text on the webpage

HTML attributes can set events where the name of the attribute is the event and the value of the attribute is the JavaScript function that we want to execute.

What is SQL?
Stands for structured query language as is used to store information in tables.

Four Languages that form the core of the World Wide Web:
HTML - structures website content
CSS - applies styling to websites
JavaScript - adds interactivity to websites
SQL - allows web application to store and retrieve data
