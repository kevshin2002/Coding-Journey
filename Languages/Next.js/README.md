## Welcome to my Next.JS Journey
This folder contains the notes from next.js, where I have decided to learn it for the sake of my future as I will need a portfolio.

**One might ask why Next.JS?** 

A simple answer is that my career is always changing and I have aspirations and findings I wish to share to the world. As all of this will continue to grow, I need a framework that will support thousands of pages in the future and not a few hundred. I have considered using Jekyll as well as many various other SSG frameworks, but Next.JS allows me to learn about SSG, SSR, and CSR. Why learn one tool when I can learn Next.JS that teaches me all the other tools?
