GitHub Pages is a tool provided by GitHub that allows us to easily create and deploy a website online.
GitHub allows us to store all the files and code for our website in a repository.
We can then use GitHub Pages to generate a personal URL and share the site with friends, family, and the world.

GitHub vs. GitHub Pages
In GitHub, code is stored in a repository, or repo.
It's like a special folder that lives online.
GitHub hosts that folder so that it's accessible to us and everywhere in the world.

We can then use our repo to contain our HTML and CSS code that defines a website.
This only displays the code like any other text.
GitHub Pages allows us to connect our repository to a unique URL so that when we go to that URL, we can see our website deployed.

Steps:
Create a Repository
username.github.io (username is your GitHub username)

We have the option to add templates, add a description, make repo private, and initialize some additional files.
These items make it easy for other developers to learn about our repo: what it's about, who can access it, who can use the code, etc.

Create First Page
Insert your HTML and CSS files or create them.
Then simply go to https://username.github.io

Troubleshooting:
If it does not work, go to Settings and scroll down to GitHub Pages.
Under Source, make sure that repo is linked to the webpage, if none is selected, select main branch.

Within the same GitHub Pages section, go to Theme Chooser and select any theme.
