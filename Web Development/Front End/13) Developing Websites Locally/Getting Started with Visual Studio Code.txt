Introduction: What are "text editors"?

Text editors are also called code editors and they're applications used by developers to write code.
They highlight and format code so that it's easier to read and understand.

Using a text editor is part of creating a development environment, which is the set of tools that are used for working on coding projects.
Specific to writing code, text editors provide a number of advantage:
Language-specific syntax highlighting
Automatic code indentation
Color schemes to suit preferences and make code easier to read
Plug-ins, or add-on programs, to catch errors in code
A tree view, or visual representation, of a project's folders and files, so it's easier to navigate personal projects
Key shortcuts, or combinations, for faster developments

An integrated development environment not only allows developers to edit, but also compile, and debug code through one application or interface.
While the text editor isn't an IDE, it has many IDE-like features that make life as a developer easier without needing a lot of resources that an IDE usually requires.

Choosing a Text Editor:
There are a number of text editors to choose from.
Visual Studio Code is one of the most popular text editors used by developers.
Others are Atom and Sublime Text.

Benefits to Visual Studio Code:
Free to use
Open-source, (a program's code can be viewed, modified, and shared)
IDE-like features
Supported by a large community of users and Microsoft
