What is Front-End?
Front end is what the user or customer interacts with. It is the first line of interaction for users. Users don't get a glimpse of what goes on behind the software such as databases and algorithms. 
Common tasks could be company page updates, new layouts or new pages, email campaigns, mobile designs, website performange and accessibility.

The three languages that's required are:
HTML - HyperText Markup Language (Skeleton/Content of Website)
CSS - Cascading Style Sheets (Clothes and Style of Website)
JavaScript - (Interaction and how the page moves)
JavaScript is language that can be executed in both browser and server which is very versatile.

An analogy could be a coffeeshop, where customers see the design and interior, which is all the front end. The back-end is the process of giving the coffee.

There are two Front-End developers:
Front-End Designers
Front-End Engineers

Designers or "developers," deal less with functionality but with designs and turning them into functional webpages.
Engineers don't deal with the designs but using the functional webpage such that it can be scaled and optimized.

What is Front End?
To accomplsih front-end design, we need user experience. This is the testing and study of how users interacts with the website such as it being easy or hard to use.
User Experience Interfaces are then yielded from this and can be used alongside the graphical design to implement a functioning website.

Issues:
Crossbrowser compatibility - some browsers may be old and can cause issues with front-end design.
Screensize - phones may be slim but tablets are wide, so this causes design issues. 
So it's hard to have a unified design that looks comsistent across all devie types.

Front-End Tech:
Content Management Systems (CMS) - WordPress or Drupal
Libraries & Frameworks - Reaact, Angular, or Vue (blueprint or shared styles)

Front-End Significance:
Brand Association - can attract users based on aesthetics and simplicity. It is essentially the digital logo.
Extension of Product towards customers
